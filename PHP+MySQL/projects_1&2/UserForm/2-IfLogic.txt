In UserForm directory


1.  Create login.php - use the same include files in userform.php; create it in the UserForm subdirectory (not includes)

make sure there is a section element, just like userform.php, you may also just copy userform.php to login.php and remove the form in the middle

2.  Call login.php in the form in userform.php (action)


3.  In login.php - at the very top, retrieve the username and password from userform.php and save them into variables

4.  In the section element in login.php create an if and else statement:

If the password that the user enters is equal to a string you make up (ie: "secretpassword" (pick something yourself)

echo "success!"

else
echo "failure!"

(or whatever message you'd like to see on the screen; keep it nice!)

You don't need the username variable at this point in the if statement.


5. Test both a good password and a password that won't work.
