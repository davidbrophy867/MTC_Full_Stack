USERFORM PROJECT

edit userform.php - between the section tags - create a form with 2 fields: username, password

use correct HTML5, all text should be in title or label elements, add a submit button.  The action of the form will be login.php 
(this doesn't exist yet) and the method is post.

INCLUDE PROJECT

create a function called signon in common.php that echos 'Welcome, (your name)' in an h2 tag
edit userform.php to call signon() above the form; refresh the page - make sure that signon shows up

ERROR FUNCTION
add a call to error() below the form, refresh the page - this will only show what happens when we make a call to a function that does not exist.  
Notice the error, then remove or comment out the function
