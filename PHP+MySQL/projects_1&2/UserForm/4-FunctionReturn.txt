1. update the function loginToSite so that if the passwords match the last line in the if statement returns true

2. update the function loginToSite so that if the passwords do not match the last line of the else statements returns false

3. in login.php create a variable that will capture what is being returned by loginToSite

4. if that variable is false, copy and paste the following line of code - this will return the user back to the userform
	<?php header("Location: userform.php"); ?>
You may research this logic.  p 455

5.  If the variable is true, do nothing (they will just stay on the login page)

6. run tests with a good password and a bad password
